java.io.streams                  vs      java.utils.stream both are diff
 fileinputstream read from excel          stream() in java 8 

Stream API's
--------------
collection  => grouping the element or objects.

stream() => process the elements or objects from the collection.


filter() => select the element in the stream and predicate show it example:- 10 element is there it shows the even number
           this method process the data inside the stream.
		purpose filter by some condition and store it other place or used that data it some where place 
		return type boolean

map()  => it transform one type to other type.example :- string to size of string 
          take the element from the stream then do some operation
           and store the element in some place. 
			

aslist()
stream()
parallelStream()
limit()
filter()

Maps & Hashmap
--------------
map ==> collection of entry

put() ==> add new entry or pair into hashmap

putAll() ==> multiple map add into single map

get()  => return the value.

remove() => remove the particular entry or pair

containsKey(key)  => return boolean.if the key is there return true or false.

containsValue()  => if the value is there return true or false.

isEmpty()    =>in hashmap is entry are is there or not.return boolean.

size()    => how many entery is there it should show.

clear()  => remove all the entry present in map.

keySet() ==> get the all keys only(keys not allow thw duplicate that y method name as set)
             return set

values() ==> get the values, not keys.
		  return collection

entryset() ==> get the keys and values.
		   return set


entry interface => (subset of hashmap class)
---------------

getKey()  => it return the key.

getValue() => it return the value 

setValue()  => it replace the value or set new value in specific key.
